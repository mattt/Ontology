# Ontology

A Swift library for working with structured data.
This library provides [JSON-LD][json-ld] serializable types
that can represent entities from various vocabularies,
with a focus on [Schema.org][schema.org].
It includes convenience initializers for types from Apple frameworks, like
[Contacts][framework-contacts] and [EventKit][framework-eventkit].

## Requirements

- Swift 6.0+ / Xcode 16+
- macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- iOS 17.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mattt/Ontology.git", from: "0.8.0")
]
```

| [QuantitativeValue](https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue) | [Measurement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/measurement) | Represents measurements with standardized units using UN/CEFACT Common Codes |
| [Trip](https://schema.org/Trip) | [MKDirections.Response](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkdirections/response), [MKDirections.ETAResponse](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkdirections/etaresponse) | Represents an itinerary of visits to one or more places with optional arrival/departure times |

### Apple WeatherKit Vocabulary

Additional types supporting [Apple WeatherKit][weatherkit]:

| Type | WeatherKit Type | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| WeatherForecast | [DayWeather](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkit/dayweather), [HourWeather](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkit/hourweather), [MinuteWeather](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkit/minuteweather) | Detailed weather forecast including temperature, precipitation, wind, sun/moon data |
| WeatherConditions | [CurrentWeather](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkit/currentweather), [HourWeather](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkit/hourweather) | Current or hourly weather conditions including temperature, wind, and humidity |

## Usage

### Creating objects and encoding as JSON-LD

```swift
import Ontology

// Create a Person
var person = Person()
person.givenName = "John"
person.familyName = "Doe"
person.email = ["john.doe@example.com"]

// Create an organization
var organization = Organization()
organization.name = "Example Corp"

// Associate person with organization
person.worksFor = organization

// Encode to JSON-LD
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
let jsonData = try encoder.encode(person)
print(String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)!)

// Output:
// {
//   "@context": "https://schema.org",
//   "@type": "Person",
//   "givenName": "John",
//   "familyName": "Doe"
// }
```

### Initializing from Apple framework types

```swift
import Ontology
import Contacts

// Convert from Apple's CNContact to Schema.org Person
let contact = CNMutableContact()
contact.givenName = "Jane"
contact.familyName = "Smith"
contact.emailAddresses = [
    CNLabeledValue(label: CNLabelHome,
                   value: "jane.smith@example.com" as NSString)
]

// Convert to Schema.org Person
let person = Person(contact)
```

### Configuring DateTime representations

By default, `DateTime` objects are encoded with their specified time zone,
or GMT/UTC if none is specified.
You can override the time zone used during encoding by providing
a specific `TimeZone` in the `JSONEncoder`'s `userInfo` dictionary:

```swift
import Ontology

// Create a DateTime object
let dateTime = DateTime(Date())

// Create an encoder that will use the local timezone
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.userInfo[DateTime.timeZoneOverrideKey] = TimeZone.current

// Or specify a particular timezone
// encoder.userInfo[DateTime.timeZoneOverrideKey] = TimeZone(identifier: "America/New_York")

// Encode using the specified timezone
let jsonData = try encoder.encode(dateTime)
```

This feature is particularly useful when:
- Working with date-only values that should be interpreted in the user's local timezone
- Ensuring consistent timezone representation across different data sources
- Presenting dates to users in their local timezone regardless of how they were originally stored

So to recap, the date encoding priority is:
1. `TimeZone` from encoder's `userInfo` (if provided)
2. `TimeZone` from the `DateTime` object (if specified)
3. GMT/UTC (default fallback)
